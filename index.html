   I'm Mary Mojoyinoluwa Oladejo, a current student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a unique degree in Global Business and Digital Arts.  I aspire to be a project manager as my passion lies in planning and organizing, whether it's projects, events, or aspects of my personal life, bringing chaos to order. I love collaborating with diverse teams, cherishing the chance to learn from their perspectives and weave those insights into cohesive strategies. My journey so far has been a dynamic mix of experiences, from working as a logistics coordinator to delving into consulting, exploring digital media, and enhancing my computing skills. These experiences have  ignited a passion for trying new things and discovering more about who I am. In my journey of learning, I've developed  a mantra that resonates with me: "Living isn't a performance; it's a long rehearsal for the moment you realize how far you've come." This encapsulates my commitment to growth, embracing challenges, savoring the journey and being authentic. I look forward to opportunities to bring these qualities to many teams  in a variety of spaces.

        Hi there &#128400
      </h1>
      <p>
       

Now that you have some insight into my academic background and future goals, I'd love to share a more personal side of myself. I'm originally from Nigeria, specifically belonging to the Yoruba tribe. My name, Mojoyinoluwa, originates from this culture and means 'I have tasted the sweetness of God.' My interests include writing, reading novels, crocheting, and exploring culture and history. However, writing holds a special place in my heart, whether it's crafting essays, short stories, poems, and more. I recently had the opportunity to contribute a poem to Trad magazine, a publication dedicated to promoting African ideas and preserving collective memories. Feel free to check it out through the link below.
